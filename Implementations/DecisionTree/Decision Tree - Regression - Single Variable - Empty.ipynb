When predicting the (continuous) label for a new observation, if the feature is less than the split point we assign one value and if it's greater than the split point we assign another value. Thus the set of possible values we can assign has size two. Clearly this is a very simple regression technique and it's unlikely we'd use this in a real scenario, but we've generated the data in a very contrived way so that it should perform reasonably here and we'll see that the decision tree can approximate non-linear functions by using techniques such as Bagging.\n",
