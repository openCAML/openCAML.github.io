# CAML: Courses in Applied Machine Learning

This repository supports the website for [openCAML](https://opencaml.github.io/) (Open Courses in Applied Machine Learning), maintained by Tom Hadfield.

The website comprises a series of modules, each concerning a different machine learning algorithm. The rationale is that one of the best ways to understand a machine learning algorithm is to programmatically implement it yourself from scratch. However, if one is getting started with machine learning, it can be difficult to select an appropriate dataset for an algorithm, to manage the general structure of the code, and to verify whether the method has been successfully implemented. For each algorithm, we provide:

* An appropriate dataset to train the algorithm on
* Explanations/Resources which will help you understand what the algorithm does
* The bare bones of the code (you have to fill in the important parts!)
* A way of verifying whether your solution works.

All of the code is contained within jupyter notebook. You can either download the notebook yourself and work on it locally, or you can complete the exercise in an online notebook. The notebooks are stored within the `Implementations` directory.
