One of the best ways of understanding how different algorithms work is to implement them yourself from scratch. 

When doing this for machine learning algorithms, it's often difficult to select an appropriate dataset and verify that the algorithm has been implemented correctly. This repo contains a series of notebooks to help you get started!
